    <h3> Steps To Making</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>

        <li> Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
            or 175 degrees C.
        </li>

        <img src="../img/bbeef2.webp" height="300" alt="All Ingredients Gathered">

        <li> Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt,
            2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.</li>

        <img src="../img/bbeef3.webp" height="300" alt="Beef on a cutting board with seasoning nearby">

        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef,
            reduce heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed until
            it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown
            crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip pieces and continue
            to cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat
            from the pan and set aside.</li>

        <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons
            butter to the drippings in the pan. When butter has melted
            add onion, mushrooms and carrots and cook 5 minutes,
            stirring often, scraping to release any browned bits
            from the bottom. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.

        </li>

        <li>Stir in wine and scrape to release any more bits from
            the pan. Return the meat to the pan, along with any
            accumulated juices and add thyme, bay leaves and
            Worcestershire.
        </li>

        <img src="../img/bbeef6.webp" height="300" alt="Veggies and Beef in a skillet">

        <li>Pour in beef broth just enough that it comes up 2/3 of
            the way up on the beef (do not fully submerge the meat
            in liquid). Bring the mixture to a simmer. </li>

        <li>Cover and place in preheated oven until meat
            is very tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

        </li>
